# Review-gate log — Architect/Reviewer verdicts

When the human relay is offline, verdicts land here instead of chat. Executing agents:
treat an entry here exactly like a pasted review. Keep working your lane's queue per the
standing steer at the bottom; **hold every finished task at the review gate** — a fresh
architect session (bootstrapped from [`architect-reviewer.md`](architect-reviewer.md))
reviews and appends verdicts.

## 2026-07-04 — T16 (seed PDF em-dash): ✅ APPROVED, closed

Re-verified independently, not from the report: `go test ./cmd/seed -count=1` green;
wiped the gitignored `core/cmd/seed/assets/` cache, reseeded a fresh in-mem server, and
`pdftotext` on the regenerated `wonderwall-vocals.pdf` extracts a correct
"Wonderwall — Vocals". The fix is the right one (cp1252 translator on every drawn
string + the info-dict UTF-8 flag), the new encoding test guards the exact mapping, and
both honest notes were correct calls: the committed demo bundle keeps its mojibake until
B02 regenerates it (per the task), and the assets-cache gotcha is real — the effective
reseed is `rm -rf core/troubadata core/cmd/seed/assets && make demo`.

## 2026-07-04 — IOS01 feasibility checkpoint: ✅ GO — carry to a PR

The spike answered the gating question the strong way (Linux cross-compiles iOS klibs;
local verification is possible) and already paid for itself by catching a real
portability bug in shipped A04 code (`LinkedHashMap(16, 0.75f, true)` is JVM-only).
Proceed with full IOS01, with these conditions:

1. **Land the LRU portability fix first as its own small commit/PR** — it's a bug in
   shipped code, independent of iOS, and deserves a standalone review entry.
2. The zip design is approved as proposed: commonMain **internal** parser
   (EOCD → central dir → local headers) with portable zip-slip + size-cap guards, and a
   tiny `expect fun rawInflate` (JVM `Inflater(nowrap)` / iOS `platform.zlib`
   `inflateInit2(-15)`); JVM-runnable tests crafted with `ZipOutputStream`.
3. If it balloons, the T10 precedent applies: **two commits max** (Storage + zip reader
   first; WebViewHost second), each individually green and held at the gate.
4. `InkOverlay` stays `TODO` (A07-blocked); I15 gates apply verbatim — platform code
   only in the seam actuals; the parser lives in commonMain as spec'd.

## Standing steer while the human is OoO

- **Core/webservice lane:** B01 (bake worker — the critical path) next; T13 then T14 as
  fillers. **T15 stays held** for an attended window — do not start it unattended.
- **Mobile lane:** IOS01 per the GO above; IOS02 may follow once IOS01 holds at its
  gate (its workflow is manual-trigger, so drafting it is safe — do not enable any
  per-push macOS job).
- Everything lands the usual way: rebase, fast-forward, verify-before-delete, CI green.
  Nothing merges without a verdict in this file or from the human.
